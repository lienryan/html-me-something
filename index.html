      <h2>Vietnam</h2>
      <article>
        <p>I was born in a small town in the North of Vietnam. Where I was born is surrounded by rice fields. I always dream about travelling all over the world. I just started travelling after I had a job in 2011 and my journeys have begun. <br><br>The first places I visited were in the South of Vietnam. After a 2 hour flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh, we had a 6 hour night bus from Ho Chi Minh city to Ca Mau province. That was also my first flight ever in my life. I had so much experience from my first far trip. Experienced the floating markets and travelled on a small boat down The Mekong river.</p>

        <p>Leaving Malaysia off to Singapore üòä It took 2 hours on bus from Malacca, Malaysia to Singapore.<br><br>
        Singapore is an island city-state in Southeast Asia. Located just off the southern tip of Malaysia, this vibrant city-state boasts a beautiful blend of Malaysian, Indian, Chinese, Arab and English cultures ‚Äì all with its own Singaporean twist.
